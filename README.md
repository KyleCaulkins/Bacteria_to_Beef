# Bacteria_to_Beef

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide Rosa, a microbiologist researcher, an interactive web page. Rosa's lab has partnered with *Improbable Beef* to find a bacteria that can make a synthetic meat taste like beef. Rosa belives there is a bacteria found in the human belly button that can provide a compound for the next best tasting product. Volunteers have provided bacteria samples from their belly buttons, and a variety of information about the volunteers was collected. The web page provides information about each volunteer's demographic information, bacteria cultures, and washing frequency. This web page will help Rosa and her team efficently work through the data that has been collected. With any luck, these experts will soon have a product available for the public.
